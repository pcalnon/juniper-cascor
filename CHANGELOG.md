## [0.3.3] - 2025-01-12

### Fixed: [0.3.3]

- **P0-001**: Fixed critical candidate training runtime errors
  - Fixed incorrect method call `_train_candidate_worker` → `_train_candidate_unit` in `train_candidate_worker()` method (cascade_correlation.py:1782)
  - Fixed `UnboundLocalError` for `traceback` variable in exception handler by adding import statement
  - Added `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` methods to `LogConfig` class to properly handle pickling of logger objects during multiprocessing
  - Added `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` methods to `CascadeCorrelationConfig` class to handle log_config serialization
  - Updated `CascadeCorrelationNetwork.__getstate__` to exclude `log_config` and activation functions from pickling
  - Updated `CascadeCorrelationNetwork.__setstate__` to reinitialize activation functions after unpickling

### Added: [0.3.3]

- **P0-004**: Added thread safety documentation
  - Added thread safety warning to README.md
  - Added thread safety warning to FEATURES_GUIDE.md
  - Added thread safety warning docstring to `CascadeCorrelationNetwork` class

## [0.3.2] - 2025-01-12

### Added: [0.3.2]

- Initial MVP release with Cascade Correlation Neural Network implementation
- HDF5 serialization support for network snapshots
- N-best candidate selection capability
- Flexible optimizer configuration
- Deterministic training with random state preservation
- Multiprocessing support for parallel candidate training
- Data integrity validation with checksums

### Notes

- Reference implementation based on Fahlman & Lebiere, 1990
